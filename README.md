If you work with multiple computers, eventually you'll find yourself needing to copy something from one to the other. If it's just a file or folder then Dropbox (or SpiderOak, etc.) will work perfectly. But what if it's just a little piece of text or a link?

**There certainly are tools available to help us:**

* [Pastebot](http://tapbots.com/software/pastebot) for Mobile
* [Pastie.org](http://pastie.org) for small and large snippets of text or code
* [CloudApp](https://www.getcloudapp.com) for any kind of content (but it comes with a price tag)

**Then we have the tried-and-true / _get er' done_ methods:**

* Makeshift Evernote or Dropbox Clipboards
* Sending an e-mail or IM to yourself
* Adding another item to Reminders or Wunderlist

We've all used these tools and methods for years, but they all tend to put us right back in cumbersome-territory, or they come with a monthly fee. Something this simple should be free, right? All we want to do is get some text from one computer to another...


### How's it work?

There's a few initial steps (see below) but after that it's a very simple process:

1. **Source:** Copy Text » Tap Chrome Button
2. **Target:** Tap Chrome Button » Paste Text

That's it. You're done in two clicks - Painless and 100% free!


### Setup

1. Head over to [UnorderedList.com](http://unorderedlist.com) and create a new list
2. Install the Chrome Button by clicking the download link
3. Setup the Chrome Button by right-clicking and selecting settings
4. Enter your list title (and optional hotkey)

You're good to go after that - Just repeat the process on your other devices.

[UnorderedList.com](http://unorderedlist.com) works without the Chrome Button (If you're not into that sort of thing). The Chrome Button just expedites the process by doing away with a few extra clicks.

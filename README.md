# UnorderedList

Have you ever found yourself needing to copy a link or text snippet to another computer?

**There certainly are tools available to help out:**

* [Pastie.org](http://pastie.org) works for large snippets of text or code (but you have to remember a complex URL)
* [Pastebot](http://tapbots.com/software/pastebot) works great for pasting to mobile devices (but it has a price tag)
* [CloudApp](https://www.getcloudapp.com) works for any kind of content (but it comes with a monthly fee)

**Then we have the tried-and-true methods:**

* Makeshift _Evernote_ or _Dropbox_ Clipboards
* Sending an e-mail or IM to yourself
* Adding another item to _Reminders_ or _Wunderlist_

We've all used these tools and methods for years, but they all tend to be a little cumbersome _or they cost money_. Something this simple should be free... _Right?_ All we want to do is get some text from one computer to another.


### How's it work?

After the initial setup (see below) it's as simple as:

#### Adding List Items _(From Source Device)_:
1. Copy the text snippet to your clipboard ( **⌘**+**C** )
2. Now add it to your list using the hotkey ( **Alt**+**Shift**+**V** )

#### Using List Items _(On Target Device)_:
1. Load the most recent list item onto your clipboard ( **Alt**+**Shift**+**C** )
2. Then just paste it anywhere you'd like ( **⌘**+**V** )


### Setup

1. Create your list at [UnorderedList.net](http://unorderedlist.net)
2. Click Download to install the [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unorderedlist/jehhmlpdedncbbemoncbfabfaongchma)
3. Click the Chrome Button to add/edit your list name

All set. You're good to go! :beers:

### _Notes_

* By default Chrome will sync the extension to your other computers
* Adjust the default hotkeys or create global keyboard shortcuts by clicking **Edit Hotkeys**

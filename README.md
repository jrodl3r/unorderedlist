#UnorderedList
_[under construction]_

If you work with multiple computers, eventually you'll find yourself needing to copy something from one to the other. If it's just a file or folder then Dropbox (or SpiderOak, etc.) will work perfectly. But what if it's just a little piece of text or a link?

**There certainly are tools available to help us:**

* [Pastebot](http://tapbots.com/software/pastebot) for Mobile
* [Pastie.org](http://pastie.org) for small and large snippets of text or code
* [CloudApp](https://www.getcloudapp.com) for any kind of content (but it comes with a price tag)

**Then we have the tried-and-true / _get er' done_ methods:**

* Makeshift Evernote or Dropbox Clipboards
* Sending an e-mail or IM to yourself
* Adding another item to Reminders or Wunderlist

We've all used these tools and methods for years, but they all tend to put us right back in cumbersome-territory, or they come with a monthly fee. Something this simple should be free, right? All we want to do is get some text from one computer to another...


### How's it work?

There's a few initial steps (see below) but after that it's a very simple process:

1. **Computer A:** Copy your text/link » Click UL Button
2. **Computer B:** Click UL Button » Paste away...

That's it. You're done in two clicks - Painless and 100% free!


### Setup

1. Go to [UnorderedList](http://unorderedlist.com) and click the download link to install the Chrome Button.
2. Create an anonymous list by entering a title into the textbox.

You're good to go after that - Just repeat the first step on your other computer(s) and load your list.

[UnorderedList](http://unorderedlist.com) works without the Chrome Button (If you're not looking to install anything). The Chrome Button just expedites the process by doing away with those extra clicks.
